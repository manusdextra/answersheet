# Answersheet

I am building this utility to practice React as well as creating forms. Its purpose is to have a quick and convenient interface for students to submit answers in a clean, predictable format which I can use to speed up (and partially automate) the marking process whereever possible. At this point, I am aiming to implement the Cambridge B2 First exam as a reference because it's the one I have most experience with.

## Goals

The MVP would be a simple form page that allows students to enter their name and their answers, which are then sent to me by whatever method is convenient. In future, I may consider implementing:

- [ ] a login function
- [ ] a database connection
- [ ] an admin dashboard
- [ ] an exercise creation form
- [ ] maybe a way to print the exam for those who can't do it online?

## Progress Notes

### Formik

I have started working with this library in the hopes that it will simplify the process. After initial frustrations, I am starting to see the benefits and I'm considering spending more time on this aspect of the project. With forms as ubiquitous as they are, I think practice in this area will be of use in many other places.

### Typescript

Since there is a fair amount of overlap between the tasks, I am using this opportunity to learn about types and how they can be extended. The different Tasks I am trying to implement are fairly diverse, so this should make for a good playground.
