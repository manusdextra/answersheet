# Answersheet

I am building this utility to practice React as well as creating forms. Its purpose is to have a quick and convenient interface for students to submit answers in a clean, predictable format which I can use to speed up (and partially automate) the marking process whereever possible.

## Goals

The MVP would be a simple form page that allows students to enter their name and their answers, which are then sent to me by whatever method is convenient.

In future, I may consider implementing:

- [ ] a login function
- [ ] a database connection
- [ ] an admin dashboard
- [ ] an exercise creation form

## Progress Notes

### Formik

I have started working with this library in the hopes that it will simplify the process. After initial frustrations, I am starting to see the benefits and I'm considering spending more time on this aspect of the project. With forms as ubiquitous as they are, I think practice in this area will be of use in many other places.
