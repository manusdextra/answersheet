# Answersheet

I am building this utility to practice React as well as creating forms. Its purpose is to have a quick and convenient interface for students to submit answers in a clean, predictable format which I can use to speed up (and partially automate) the marking process whereever possible.

## Goals

The MVP would be a simple form page that allows students to enter their name and their answers, which are then sent to me by whatever method is convenient.

In future, I may consider implementing:
- [ ] a login function
- [ ] a database connection
